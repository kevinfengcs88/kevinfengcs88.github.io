## About

> Hi there, I'm Kevin 👋

I'm currently a computer science student at Rutgers University and part of the HackRU RnD backend team. I write for my personal Medium site and the SAS Honors Program blog on a wide variety of topics, including coding, psychology, anime, monkeys, you get the idea. I'm extremely passionate about PC building, *The Lord of the Rings*, and Wim Hof (I only take cold showers!). I'm currently looking for a programming internship, especially in the field of web development.
