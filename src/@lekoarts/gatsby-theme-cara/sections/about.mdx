> Hi there, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I'm an honors computer science graduate from Rutgers University passionate about the world of DevOps and fintech. I write about my personal interests on my Medium blog. Here are just a few of those topics:
- Cold therapy
- Vim
- Calisthenics
- Medium-sized mammals native to Southeast Asia

There's not much of a pattern here.
