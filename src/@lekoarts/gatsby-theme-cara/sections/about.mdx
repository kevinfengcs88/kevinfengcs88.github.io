## About

> Hi there, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at Rutgers University and part of the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program (SASHP). I write for my personal Medium site and the SASHP blog on a wide variety of topics, including coding, psychology, anime, etc. I'm extremely passionate about PC building, *The Lord of the Rings*, and Wim Hof (I only take cold showers!). I'm currently looking for a software engineering internship, but I'm also open to other opportunities.
